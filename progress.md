## 2026-03-06 – F029
**Feature:** Student Prisma Schema Models

**Implementation:**

- Added `Student` model with fields: `id`, `sisStudentId` (unique), `fullName`, `email` (unique), `status`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- added `StudentID` model with fields: `id`, `photoUrl` (nullable), `expirationDate`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `studentId` (unique foreign key)
- established one-to-one relationship between `Student` and `StudentID` with cascade delete/update
- added appropriate indexes for query performance: `email`, `status`, `sisStudentId` on Student; `studentId`, `expirationDate` on StudentID
- applied unique constraints on `sisStudentId` and `email` fields
- all required fields have NOT NULL constraints

- Migration creates tables correctly: Migration `20260306055724_add_student_models` created and applied successfully
- Relations between Student and StudentID are properlyly defined: one-to-one relationship with cascade delete/update properly configured

**Tests:**

- ✅ Schema file validates with Prisma: `npx prisma validate` passed
- ✅ Migration creates tables correctly: Migration created and applied to database successfully
- ✅ Relations between Student and StudentID are properlyly defined: one-to-one relationship with cascade
- ✅ Required fields have appropriate constraints: all required fields have NOT null, unique constraints on appropriate fields
- ✅ Build succeeds: `npm run build` passed (Prisma Client generated correctly)

**Migration Details:**

- Migration file: `prisma/migrations/20260306055724_add_student_models/migration.sql`
- Tables created: `Student`, `StudentID`
- Indexes created: 7 indexes (2 unique, 5 regular)
- Foreign key: `StudentID.studentId` → `Student.id` with CASCADE

**Files Modified:**

- `prisma/schema.prisma` - added Student and StudentID models

## 2026-03-06 – F030 (Test Fixes)

**Feature:** FACTS SIS Student Sync Service

**Issue:** F030 was implemented but had 3 failing tests and the features.json metadata was not updated.

**Test Fixes Applied:**

1. **Whitespace trimming fix** (`facts-api.server.ts`):
   - Fixed `transformStudentToStudent()` to normalize multiple spaces to single space
   - Applied `.replace(/\s+/g, ' ')` to `fullName` regardless of source (name field or built from parts)

2. **API key authentication fix** (`tests/mocks/facts.ts`):
   - Fixed mock server to check for `Facts-Api-Key` header instead of `Ocp-Apim-Api-Key`
   - This matches the actual service implementation which sends `Facts-Api-Key`

3. **Profile picture test fix** (`facts-api.server.test.ts`):
   - Updated test to use a longer base64 string (108+ chars) that passes the minimum length validation
   - The code checks for `base64Data.length < 100` and calls console.warn if too short

**Tests:**

- ✅ All 48 FACTS API tests pass
- ✅ All 13 student-sync tests pass
- ✅ Total: 61 tests pass for F030

**Files Modified:**

- `app/utils/facts-api.server.ts` - Fixed whitespace normalization
- `app/utils/facts-api.server.test.ts` - Fixed profile picture test data
- `tests/mocks/facts.ts` - Fixed API key header name

---

## 2026-03-06 – F038

**Feature:** Google OAuth Integration for Students

**Implementation:**

- Updated OAuth callback handler (`app/routes/_auth/auth.$provider/callback.ts`) to:
  - Check for both Employee and Student records when processing Google OAuth
  - Create User account and StudentID record automatically for students on first login
  - Set default July 1 expiration date for new StudentID records
  - Preserve existing StudentID records on subsequent logins

- Updated `getRedirectPathForUser()` function (`app/utils/auth.server.ts`) to:
  - Check for Student records in addition to Employee records
  - Redirect students to `/student/id` instead of `/employee/id`
  - Prioritize: Admin role > Employee > Student > fallback to /

- **Authentication Flow for Students:**
  1. User authenticates with Google OAuth using @jpgacademy.org email
  2. Callback handler checks if email matches an Employee record (first priority)
  3. If not an employee, checks if email matches a Student record
  4. If student exists in SIS, creates User account and StudentID automatically
  5. Creates session and redirects to `/student/id`
  6. If student not in SIS, redirects to onboarding

**Tests:**

- Created comprehensive test suite with 21 tests (11 callback + 10 auth.server tests)
- ✅ Student can authenticate with Google OAuth using @jpgacademy.org email
- ✅ First-time student login creates Student record if in SIS
- ✅ Returning students can log in successfully
- ✅ Session is created and maintained correctly for students
- ✅ Students are distinguished from employees in the system
- ✅ Student is redirected to student ID page, not employee ID page
- ✅ Student without existing StudentID gets one created automatically
- ✅ Existing StudentID is preserved on subsequent logins
- ✅ Student with inactive status can still authenticate
- ✅ Student not in SIS goes to onboarding
- ✅ Admin student goes to admin dashboard, not student ID page
- ✅ All 21 tests pass

**Files Created:**

- `app/routes/_auth/auth.$provider/callback.student.test.ts` - Student OAuth callback tests (11 tests)
- `app/utils/auth.server.student.test.ts` - getRedirectPathForUser tests for students (10 tests)

**Files Modified:**

- `app/routes/_auth/auth.$provider/callback.ts` - Added student OAuth handling
- `app/utils/auth.server.ts` - Updated getRedirectPathForUser to handle students

## 2026-03-06 – Student FACTS Profile Picture Integration

**Feature:** FACTS Profile Picture Integration for Students (matching employee functionality)

**Issue:** Student IDs were not pulling photos from FACTS like staff IDs do. The integration only existed in the student's own ID view, but was missing from admin views and PDF generation.

**Implementation:**

- Added FACTS profile picture integration to **Admin Student Detail View** (`/admin/students/$studentId`):
  - Fetches FACTS profile picture if no uploaded photo exists
  - Caches photo in storage and updates StudentID.photoUrl
  - Gracefully handles errors (continues without photo if API fails)
  - Uploaded photos always take precedence over FACTS photos

- Added FACTS profile picture integration to **Admin Student PDF Download** (`/resources/admin/student-pdf.$studentId`):
  - Fetches FACTS profile picture before PDF generation
  - Ensures PDFs include student photos from FACTS when available
  - Auto-creates StudentID record with default expiration if missing

- Added FACTS profile picture integration to **Student's Own PDF Download** (`/resources/student-pdf`):
  - Fetches FACTS profile picture before PDF generation
  - Students downloading their own PDFs will now include FACTS photos
  - Auto-creates StudentID record with default expiration if missing

- Updated test files to mock `fetchAndCacheFactsProfilePicture`:
  - `app/routes/admin/students/$studentId.test.ts` - Added vi.mock for student.server
  - `app/routes/resources/student-pdf.test.ts` - Added vi.mock for student.server
  - `app/routes/resources/admin/student-pdf.$studentId.test.ts` - Added vi.mock for student.server

**Behavior:**

The system now follows this priority for student photos:
1. **Uploaded photo** (admin-uploaded) - **highest priority**
2. **FACTS profile picture** (fetched from API and cached) - **fallback**
3. **No Photo placeholder** - if neither available

**Key Features:**

- ✅ Fetches profile picture from FACTS API endpoint `/People/{personId}/ProfilePicture`
- ✅ Uses `sisStudentId` as the `personId` parameter
- ✅ Caches fetched photo in local storage (students/{studentId}/photos/)
- ✅ Updates StudentID.photoUrl with cached photo path
- ✅ Uploaded photos always take precedence
- ✅ Graceful error handling (continues without photo on API errors)
- ✅ Consistent with employee photo handling

**Tests:**

- ✅ All 15 admin student detail tests pass
- ✅ All 8 student PDF download tests pass
- ✅ All 9 admin student PDF download tests pass
- ✅ Total: 32 tests pass
- ✅ Build succeeds

**Files Modified:**

- `app/routes/admin/students/$studentId.tsx` - Added FACTS photo integration to loader
- `app/routes/resources/admin/student-pdf.$studentId.tsx` - Added FACTS photo integration to loader
- `app/routes/resources/student-pdf.tsx` - Added FACTS photo integration to loader
- `app/routes/admin/students/$studentId.test.ts` - Added vi.mock for student.server
- `app/routes/resources/student-pdf.test.ts` - Added vi.mock for student.server
- `app/routes/resources/admin/student-pdf.$studentId.test.ts` - Added vi.mock for student.server

**Note:**

The verification route (`/verify/$id`) already had FACTS profile picture integration for both employees and students, so no changes were needed there.

---

## Summary

✅ **FACTS Profile Picture Integration for Students Complete**

All student-related routes now pull photos from FACTS SIS just like staff IDs do. The integration is consistent across:
- Student's own ID view (`/student/id`) - **already had it**
- Admin student detail view (`/admin/students/$studentId`) - **now added**
- Admin student PDF download (`/resources/admin/student-pdf.$studentId`) - **now added**
- Student's own PDF download (`/resources/student-pdf`) - **now added**
- Public verification page (`/verify/$id`) - **already had it**

The photo priority is: Uploaded Photo > FACTS Photo > No Photo Placeholder

## 2026-03-06 – FACTS Profile Picture Rate Limiting

**Feature:** Rate Limiting for FACTS Profile Picture API Calls

**Issue:** The initial implementation fetched profile pictures on every page load/PDF generation, which would quickly hit FACTS API rate limits.

**Solution:** Implemented a comprehensive rate limiting and caching strategy:

### Database Changes

- Added `factsPhotoCheckedAt` field to `EmployeeID` and `StudentID` models
- Created migration to add the timestamp field with indexes
- Tracks when we last checked FACTS for a profile picture

### Rate Limiting Strategy

1. **On-Demand Fetching** (page loads, PDF generation):
   - Only fetches if we haven't checked FACTS in the last **7 days**
   - Prevents repeated API calls on every page load
   - Checks `factsPhotoCheckedAt` timestamp before making API calls
   - Uploaded photos always take precedence

2. **Scheduled Batch Fetching** (during SIS sync):
   - Photos are fetched during the scheduled sync job
   - Runs during off-peak hours (configurable)
   - Processes all active employees/students in batches
   - Respects the 7-day rate limit per person
   - Continues even if individual photo fetches fail

3. **Priority System**:
   - **Highest**: Uploaded photo (admin-uploaded)
   - **Fallback**: FACTS profile picture (cached)
   - **Last resort**: No Photo placeholder

### Implementation Details

**Updated Functions:**

- `fetchAndCacheFactsProfilePicture()` (both employee and student versions):
  - Checks `factsPhotoCheckedAt` before making API calls
  - Updates timestamp even before API call (prevents concurrent checks)
  - Returns `null` if checked within last 7 days
  - Accepts `force` parameter to bypass rate limiting

- `syncStudentsFromFacts()` and `syncEmployeesFromFacts()`:
  - Fetches photos during scheduled sync
  - Respects the 7-day rate limit
  - Logs warnings but doesn't fail the sync on photo errors

**Test Updates:**

- Added mocks for `fetchAndCacheFactsProfilePicture` in test files:
  - `app/routes/employee/id.test.ts`
  - `app/routes/admin/employees/$employeeId.test.ts`
  - `app/routes/student/id.test.ts`
  - `app/routes/admin/students/$studentId.test.ts`
  - `app/routes/resources/student-pdf.test.ts`
  - `app/routes/resources/admin/student-pdf.$studentId.test.ts`

**Files Modified:**

- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added `factsPhotoCheckedAt` to EmployeeID and StudentID
- `app/utils/employee.server.ts` - Added rate limiting logic
- `app/utils/student.server.ts` - Added rate limiting logic
- `app/utils/student-sync.server.ts` - Added photo fetching during sync
- `app/utils/employee-sync.server.ts` - Already had photo fetching during sync
- Test files - Added mocks to prevent API calls during tests

### Benefits

- ✅ Prevents hitting FACTS API rate limits
- ✅ Reduces API calls by ~99% (only checks once per week per person)
- ✅ Photos still available on first load (background fetch)
- ✅ Scheduled sync ensures photos are kept up-to-date
- ✅ Graceful degradation (works even if API is unavailable)
- ✅ No impact on user experience (photos cached in storage)

### Configuration

The rate limit can be configured by changing the `DAYS_BEFORE_RECHECK` constant in the `fetchAndCacheFactsProfilePicture` functions (currently set to 7 days).

## 2026-03-10 – F043

**Feature:** Gmail Signature Viewing for Admins

**Implementation:**

- Created `GmailSignatureService` class in `app/utils/gmail-signature.server.ts`:
  - Uses Google Workspace domain-wide delegation with service account
  - Fetches signatures via Gmail API endpoint `/users/{email}/settings/sendAs/{email}`
  - Caches signatures to database (`gmailSignature` and `gmailSignatureFetchedAt` fields)
  - Rate limiting: only fetches if not cached or stale (> 7 days old)
  - Graceful error handling (continues without signature on API errors)

- Updated `EmployeeID` Prisma schema:
  - Added `gmailSignature String?` field (HTML signature)
  - Added `gmailSignatureFetchedAt DateTime?` field (cache timestamp)
  - Created migration `20260312012644_add_gmail_signature_fields`

- Updated admin employee detail page (`app/routes/admin/employees/$employeeId.tsx`):
  - Displays Gmail signature in new "Gmail Signature" section
  - Shows "Last updated" timestamp
  - Background fetch when signature missing or stale
  - Graceful fallback when no signature available
  - Renders HTML signature safely with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`

**Tests:**

- ✅ Service fetches signature via service account impersonation
- ✅ Signature is cached to database
- ✅ Signature is displayed on admin employee detail page
- ✅ Background refresh triggers when cache is stale (> 7 days)
- ✅ Background refresh triggers when signature is missing
- ✅ Graceful handling when service account not configured
- ✅ Graceful handling when API call fails
- ✅ All 8 tests pass (4 service tests + 4 loader tests)
- ✅ Build succeeds

**Files Created:**

- `app/utils/gmail-signature.server.ts` - Gmail signature service
- `app/utils/gmail-signature.server.test.ts` - Service tests (4 tests)
- `app/routes/admin/employees/$employeeId.gmail.test.ts` - Loader tests (4 tests)

**Files Modified:**

- ✅ HTML signatures rendered with proper styling
- ✅ Works even if service account not configured (graceful degradation)

---

## Summary

✅ **FACTS Profile Picture Rate Limiting Complete**

The system now intelligently manages FACTS API calls to avoid rate limiting:
- Only checks FACTS once per week per person (configurable)
- Fetches photos during scheduled syncs (batch operation)
- Cached photos are served from storage (no API calls)
- Uploaded photos always take precedence
- Graceful error handling ensures system remains functional even if FACTS API is unavailable

- Created migration `20260308045042_add_sync_type_to_sync_history`
- Updated existing sync history records to have `syncType: 'staff'`

### Sync Service Updates

- Updated `employee-sync.server.ts` to log sync history with `syncType: 'staff'`
- Updated `student-sync.server.ts` to log sync history with `syncType: 'student'`
- Both services now properly record sync history with their respective types

### Admin Sync Status Page Rewrite

Completely rewrote `/admin/sync-status` to display both staff and student sync information:

**Loader Changes:**
- Fetches separate last sync history for staff and students
- Calculates separate statistics (total, active, inactive) for both
- Fetches separate recent sync errors for both types
- Identifies staff and students with sync issues (not updated in 7 days)

**UI Changes:**
- Added tab-like navigation between Staff and Students sections
- Two separate sync status cards (one for staff, one for students)
- Each section has its own:
  - Last sync status (success/failure, timestamp, counts)
  - Sync statistics (total, active, inactive)
  - Recent sync errors list
  - Persons with sync issues list
  - Sync Now button with confirmation dialog

**Action Changes:**
- Added `sync-staff` intent for staff sync
- Added `sync-students` intent for student sync
- Separate toast messages for each sync type

**Tests:**

- ✅ Dashboard displays last staff sync timestamp
- ✅ Dashboard displays last student sync timestamp
- ✅ Dashboard shows staff sync errors if any occurred
- ✅ Dashboard shows student sync errors if any occurred
